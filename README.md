# SAR-ADC
Designed and simulated a Successive Approxima‐
tion Register Analog‐to‐Digital Converter (SAR ADC)
using MATLAB Simulink. Implemented the successive
approximation algorithm for precise analog‐to‐digital
conversion, conducted thorough testing and validation, and demonstrated the model’s accuracy and
efficiency through simulation results.
